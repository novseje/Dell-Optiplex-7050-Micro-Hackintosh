# Dell Optiplex 7050 Micro BIOS Settings

I'll just lay out the way my BIOS is shown and whatever is ticked/selected so you can copy it on yours, and hopefully make it work. Make sure your BIOS is updated to at least what mine is and it's always best to **Reset to Factory Defaults** before starting to flick switches (from personal experience, resetting BIOS does sometimes flip hidden switches, in case anybody tried to screw around with it before). I am running the latest BIOS 1.24.0 and you should too.

# Settings
## General
- **System Information** - Not much to change here, it's just information about your Optiplex
- **Boot Sequence** - Make sure it's set to UEFI and the only boot option is your drive with the EFI (depends how many drives you have and if you dualboot)
- **Advanced Boot Options** - Untick "Enable Legacy Option ROMs" and "Enable Attempt Legacy Boot" should be greyed out
- **UEFI Booth Path Security** - Left as default at "Always, Except Internal HDD". I don't  think it changes anything
- **Date/Time** - Left as default, it's just time settings

## System Configuration
- **Integrated NIC** - Untick "Enable UEFI Network Stack" and select Enabled (or not, if you don't want Ethernet)
- **SATA Operation** - Select "AHCI" and make sure it's enabled before installing anything, RAID On is only a driver for Windows 7 which didn't support RAID at the time, you want the AHCI option here
- **Drives** - Leave all ticked, may be different for you. I had SATA-0, SATA-4 and M.2 PCIe SSD-0.
- **SMART Reporting** - "Enable SMART Reporting" is enabled/ticked. Probably doesn't matter, but I like to have it on
- **USB Configuration** - Everything is ticked, "Enable USB Boot Support", "Enable Front USB Ports" and "Enable Rear USB Ports". Self explanatory
- **Front USB Configuration** - All options enabled/ticked
- **Rear USB Configuration** - All options enabled/ticked
- **USB PowerShare** - "Enable USB PowerShare" is disabled/unticked. It may cause problems with graphics later if enabled, leave it off
- **Audio** - Everything is enabled/ticked here too
- **Dust Filter Maintenance** - I left it at disabled, there isn't even any dust filter in the Micro version, must be an oversight ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Video
- **Primary Display** - Set it as "Intel HD Graphics" instead of Auto, just to reinforce it to use the iGPU (unless you have a bigger Optiplex with a dedicated AMD GPU or an [old NVIDIA GPU](https://dortania.github.io/GPU-Buyers-Guide/modern-gpus/nvidia-gpu.html) that is still supported)

## Security
- **Admin Password** - Left as default
- **System Password** - Left as default
- **Internal HDD-0 Password** - Left as default
- **Strong Password** - "Enable Strong Password" is unticked
- **Password Configuration** - Left as default
- **Password Bypass** - Left as default
- **Password Change** - Left as default, "Allow Non-Admin Password Changes" is ticked
- **UEFI Capsule Firmware Updates** - "Enable UEFI Capsule Firmware Updates" is disabled/unticked
- **TPM 1.2 Security** - "TPM On" is disabled/unticked
- **Computrace(R)** - Deactivate this, never used it and macOS doesn't need it
- **Chassis Intrusion** - Left as default, you can change to your preference
- **CPU XD Support** - **MAKE SURE TO ENABLE CPU XD SUPPORT!!!** If disabled, computer immediately restarts after trying to boot and you cannot progress. I even had to DM a couple Reddit users who had the same computer as me to ask for help, only to realise I disabled it
- **OROM Keyboard Access** - Left as default
- **Admin Setup Lockout** - Left as default
- **Master Password Lockout** - Left as default
- **SMM Security Mitigation** - Left as default

## Secure Boot
- **Secure Boot Enable** - Obviously disabled, absolutely useless
- **Expert Key Management** - Left as default

## Intel R Software Guard Extensions TM
- **Intel R SGX TM Enable** - Disabled
- **Enclave Memory Size** - This is greyed out since it's disabled

## Performance
- **Multi Core Support** - Enable all cores
- **Intel R SpeedStep TM** - Enabled
- **C-States Control** - "C states" is enabled
- **Limit CPUID Value** - This is unticked
- **Intel R TurboBoost TM** - Enabled
- **HyperThread control** - Enabled

## Power Management
- **AC Recovery** - I keep this enabled, so the computer starts again in case of power loss, totally up to you
- **Auto On Time** - Left as default
- **Deep Sleep Control** - Disabled
- **USB Wake Support** - This is unticked
- **Wake on LAN/WLAN** - Disabled
- **Block Sleep** - "Block Sleep (S3 State)" is unticked
- **Intel Ready Mode** - Disabled

## POST Behaviour
- **Adapter Warnings** - Disabled, to prevent the boot process from being halted
- **Numlock LED** - Enabled, up to you though
- **Keyboard Errors** - Disabled
- **Fastboot** - Set this to Thorough, Minimal tends to prevent you from booting USB drives
- **Extend BIOS POST Time** - 0 seconds
- **Full Screen Logo** - Disabled
- **Warning and Errors** - Continue on Warnings and Errors

## Manageability
- **USB Provision** - Disabled
- **MEBx Hotkey** - Enabled, doesn't matter

## Virtualization Support

- **Trusted Execution** - Disabled, it will probably be greyed out

## Wireless
- **Wireless Device Enable** - Enabled, self explanatory

## Maintenance
- **Service Tag** - This is just information
- **Asset Tag** - This is just information
- **SERR Messages** - Enabled
- **BIOS Downgrade** - Enabled, doesn't matter
- **Data Wipe** - Disabled forever, unless you want the computer to erase everything on the next boot
- **BIOS Recovery** - BIOS Recovery from Hard Drive is enabled, BIOS Auto-Recovery is disabled, I don't think this matters though

## System Logs

## Advanced configurations
